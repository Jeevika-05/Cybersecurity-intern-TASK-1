# 🔍 Cybersecurity Internship – Task 1: Network Port Scanning

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates basic network reconnaissance using **Nmap** and **Wireshark**, including local and network-wide port scanning, UDP service simulation, and packet inspection.

## 📁 Contents

- `scan_results/` – Nmap scan outputs (self-scan, network scan, UDP scan)
- `screenshots/` – Terminal and Wireshark screenshots
- `udp_server.py` – Python script simulating a UDP service on port 9999
- `README.md` – Summary of the task and contents

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Nmap (TCP SYN & UDP scans)
- Wireshark (packet analysis)
- Python 3 (UDP server)
- Kali Linux VM (VirtualBox)

## ✅ Task Summary

- Performed port scan on localhost
- Launched an HTTP server to confirm open TCP port
- Conducted a full network scan to identify live hosts and services
- Simulated a UDP service and scanned for it
- Used Wireshark to observe and analyze network traffic
